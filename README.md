# hello-world
a test repository
I have a PhD in Nuclear Engineering, and have experience programming in basic languages in a very traditional way; I worte the source code, and then compiled it in a compiler and ran the executable. I've done this in FORTRAN, C, C++, and a little bit in Python. I have the technical background for physics and mathematics based programming, but only a basic understanding of software engineering as a discipline. I'm new to Github but think it's an excellent resource in principle i'd like to learn more about how it works and use it to improve my CS understanding.
